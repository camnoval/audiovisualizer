    <h2>About AlbumViz</h2>
    <p>
      AlbumViz is a creative visualization tool that transforms music into art. By mapping audio
      frequencies to colors, AlbumViz creates posters, gradients, and digital artwork that allow
      you to <strong>see your music</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The algorithm uses a logarithmic frequency-to-color mapping inspired by how humans perceive
      both sound and light. Low frequencies shift toward warmer colors, while higher frequencies
      are represented by cooler tones, producing a natural and immersive translation of sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      AlbumViz was originally developed by <strong>Cameron Noval</strong> as a blend of physics,
      art, and coding. Today it serves as both an art gallery and a tool for musicians, educators,
      and fans who want to experience music in a new way.
    </p>
    <p>
      We believe strongly in privacy â€” AlbumViz runs locally on your computer. Your music is never
      uploaded or shared. If you request a poster, only the final artwork (not your songs) is used
      to create the print.
