    <p><strong>See your music. Hear your light.</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>AlbumViz</strong> is an interactive tool that transforms sound into color using real audio data and scientific mapping.
      Whether you enter an album name or a YouTube music video, AlbumViz analyzes the full frequency spectrum of the audio ‚Äî 
      from sub-bass at 20 Hz to piercing highs at 20,000 Hz ‚Äî and converts it into visible light wavelengths between 
      400 nm (violet) and 700 nm (red).
    </p>

    <h2>üé® Why AlbumViz Matters</h2>
    <p>
      Music is more than just sound‚Äîit's an experience that can evoke powerful emotions, memories, and even visual imagery. AlbumViz bridges the gap between hearing and seeing by translating the unique frequency patterns of your favorite songs into vibrant color gradients. This process not only creates beautiful visual art but also provides a new way to understand and appreciate the structure of music.
    </p>
    <p>
      For musicians, AlbumViz offers a fresh perspective on composition and arrangement, revealing the hidden architecture of sound. For educators, it serves as a valuable teaching tool to demonstrate the relationship between physics, math, and art. And for music lovers, it‚Äôs a fun and engaging way to explore the songs you love in a whole new light‚Äîliterally!
    </p>
    <p>
      Each visualization is unique, reflecting the dynamic range and complexity of the audio. From the deep, pulsing bass of electronic music to the soaring highs of a violin solo, AlbumViz captures it all and presents it as a continuous spectrum of color. This not only makes for stunning visuals but also helps you "see" the energy and emotion embedded in every track.
    </p>

    <h2>üî¨ How It Works</h2>
    <p>
      AlbumViz uses advanced audio analysis techniques to break down your music into its core components. The process starts by dividing the audio into 1,000 segments, regardless of the song's length. For each segment, the dominant frequency is detected using digital signal processing algorithms. This frequency is then mapped to a specific wavelength of visible light using a logarithmic scale, ensuring that the full range of human hearing is represented proportionally in the color spectrum.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Upload your song, playlist, album, or link from YouTube.</li>
      <li>The song is cut into 1,000 segments (different songs are different lengths).</li>
      <li>For each segment, the dominant frequency (between 20 Hz and 20,000 Hz) is detected.</li>
      <li>This frequency is plugged into a logarithmic equation to get a wavelength between 400 nm (violet) and 700 nm (red).</li>
      <li>Each wavelength is mapped to a specific color (e.g., 400 nm = violet, 700 nm = red).</li>
      <li>All the colors are collected in order.</li>
      <li>The result is a beautiful gradient that visually represents your music!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Our ears perceive sound <strong>logarithmically</strong>, meaning we‚Äôre more sensitive to <em>ratios</em> of frequencies 
      than to absolute differences. AlbumViz reflects this by converting the <strong>logarithm of frequency</strong> into visible color.
    </p>
    <p>
      This approach is grounded in both psychoacoustics and physics. The logarithmic mapping ensures that low and high frequencies are represented fairly, mimicking the way our ears naturally interpret sound. The result is a visualization that is both scientifically accurate and aesthetically pleasing.
    </p>
    <p>Here‚Äôs the formula used:</p>
    <!-- Load MathJax for LaTeX rendering -->
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js" async></script>
    <p>
      <span style="font-size:1.2em;">
      $$\lambda = 700 - 300 \times \frac{\log_{10}(f) - \log_{10}(20)}{\log_{10}(20000) - \log_{10}(20)}$$
      </span>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>\(\lambda\)</code>: Wavelength in nanometers (400‚Äì700 nm)</li>
      <li><code>f</code>: Frequency in Hz (20‚Äì20,000 Hz)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      By applying this formula, AlbumViz ensures that every nuance in your music is captured and translated into a corresponding color, creating a one-of-a-kind visual fingerprint for each track.
