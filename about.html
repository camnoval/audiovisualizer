    <h2>About AlbumViz</h2>
    <p>
      AlbumViz is a creative visualization project that transforms music into stunning works of digital art. 
      Using real-time frequency analysis and color-mapping techniques, AlbumViz makes sound visible by translating audio frequencies into colors, patterns, and textures.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Mission</h3>
    <p>
      The mission of AlbumViz is to bridge the worlds of art, science, and technology. 
      By blending the physics of sound and light with modern visualization techniques, we aim to create tools that are both entertaining and educational.
    </p>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>
      AlbumViz applies a logarithmic frequency-to-color mapping inspired by how humans perceive sound and light. 
      Low frequencies are mapped to deeper tones, while higher frequencies are mapped to brighter, more energetic colors. 
      This process results in unique visual signatures for each track or album, making every visualization one-of-a-kind.
    </p>

    <h3>Who We Serve</h3>
    <p>
      - <strong>Music Fans:</strong> Discover new ways to experience your favorite albums visually.<br>
      - <strong>Artists & Musicians:</strong> Generate unique artwork that represents your sound.<br>
      - <strong>Educators:</strong> Use visualizations to explain frequency, sound perception, and wave physics in an engaging way.<br>
      - <strong>Collectors:</strong> Request high-quality poster prints of visualizations for display.
    </p>

    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>
      AlbumViz was created by <strong>Cameron Noval</strong> as an exploration of digital art and computational creativity. 
      What started as a small side project has grown into a platform that blends programming, design, and music into something fresh and exciting.
    </p>

    <h3>Open Source Roots</h3>
    <p>
      The underlying code for AlbumViz began as an open-source project. While the website now focuses on showcasing completed works and offering poster prints, 
      those interested in contributing or learning from the project can explore the original repository on 
      <a href="https://github.com/camnoval/audioVisualizer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.
    </p>
